TimeStamp Prefixer
==================

TimeStamp Prefixer takes all the files in a specified folder, creates a timestamp of the form yyyyMMddHHmmss and then prefixes that timestamp to each file name. Note that the folder parsing is not recursive in nature.

The files are all backed up before the process is undertaken.
